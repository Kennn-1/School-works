I’m learning how to set up a Flutter starter project and structure the widgets. (The next three chapters will dive deeper into widgets, so I’ll get plenty of practice there.) Every time I start a new example in future chapters, I’ll refer back to this one since it covers the essential steps for creating a solid foundation for any app 

STRUCTURING WIDGETS 

you start developing an app, it’s important to create your structure Structuring widgets in an organized manner improves the code’s readability and maintainability. When creating a new Flutter project, the software development kit (SDK) does not automatically create the separate home.dart file, which contains the main presentation page when the app starts. Note for the import package that you’ll be using Google’s Material Design. All the examples in the book import and use Material Design. In Chapter 2, you learned that Material Design is a system of best-practice guidelines for user interface design. The Material Design components in a Flutter project are visual, behavioral, and motion widgets.  

In this chapter, I learned how to set up a starter project that I’ll use for all the apps in this book. I used the mkdir command to create folders and organize the logic, and I created two Dart files: main.dart for the main() function that starts the app, and home.dart to hold the code for the Home widget. 

Next, I’ll dive into analyzing the widget tree. Flutter works by nesting widgets, but I’ll soon see how this can impact readability and maintainability. I’m excited to learn how to flatten the widget tree to make my code cleaner and easier to manage.
