Dart is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language, has a class-based style, and uses a C-style syntax. If you are familiar with the C#, C++, Swift, Kotlin, and Java/JavaScript languages, you will be able to start developing in Dart quickly. But don’t worry—even if you are not familiar with these other languages, Dart is a straightforward language to learn, and you can get started relatively quickly. Dart is ahead-of-time (AOT) compiled to native code, making your Flutter app fast. Dart also is just-in-time (JIT) compiled, making it fast to display your code changes such as via Flutter’s stateful hot reload feature. Since Flutter uses Dart, all the sample user interface (UI) code in this book is written in Dart, removing the need to use separate languages (markup, visual designer) to create the UI. Flutter rendering runs at 60 frames per second (fps) and 120fps (for capable devices of 120Hz). The more fps, the smoother the app. 

There are three types of comments: single-line, multiline, and documentation comments. Single-line comments are commonly used to add a short description. 

The main() function is where the app execution starts and returns a void with an optional List parameter for arguments. Each function can return a value, and for the main() function the data return type is a void (empty, contains nothing), meaning that it does not return a value. 

I’ve learned that there are three different ways to use the main() function, but I’m sticking with the arrow syntax: void main() => runApp(MyApp());. It’s cleaner and keeps the code on one line, which I find makes it easier to read. Now I understand that variables store references to values. Next, I’ll dive into the different ways I can declare variables and explore the options available. Declaring variables as numbers restricts the values to numbers only. Dart allows numbers to be int (integer) or double. Use the int declaration if your numbers do not require decimal point precision, like 10 or 40. Use the double declaration if your numbers require decimal point precision, like 50.25 or 135.7521. Both int and double allow for positive and negative numbers, and you can enter extremely large numbers and decimal precision since they both use 64-bit (computer memory) values. Declaring variables as String allows values to be entered as a sequence of text characters. To add a single line of characters, you can use single or double quotes like 'car' or "car". To add multiline characters, use triple quotes 

Declaring variables as bool (Boolean) allows a value of true or false to be entered. 

Declaring variables as List (comparable to arrays) allows multiple values to be entered; a List is an ordered group of objects. In programming, an array is an iterable (accessed sequentially) collection of objects, with each element accessible by the index position or a key. To access elements, the List uses A List can be of fixed length or growable, depending on your needs. By default, a List is created as growable by using List() or []. Maps are invaluable in associating a List of values by a Key and a Value. In Dart, declaring variables as Runes are the UTF-32 code points of a String An operator is a symbol used to perform arithmetic, equality, relational, type test, assignment, logical, conditional, and cascade notation. Tables 3.1 through 3.7 go over some of the common operators. For the sample code, I use the values directly to simplify the examples instead of using variables. The if statement compares an expression, and if true, it executes the code logic. The expression is wrapped by open and close parentheses followed by the code logic wrapped in braces. The ternary operator takes three arguments, and it’s usually used when only two actions are needed. The ternary operator checks the first argument for comparison, the second is the action if the argument is true, and the third is the action if the argument is false The standard for loop allows you to iterate a List of values. 

 Values are obtained by restricting the number of loops by a defined length. of values), and the List class conforms to this type. Unlike the standard for loop, the for-in loop iterates through every object in the List, exposing each object’s properties values 

Using the break statement allows you to stop looping by evaluating a condition inside the while loop. In this example, the askToOpen() method is called inside the loop by the if statement, executing logic that returns a bool value of true or false. As long as the value returned is false, the loop continues as normal by calling the checkForNewOrder() method. But once askToOpen() returns a value of true, the break statement is executed, stopping the loop. The checkForNewOrder() method is not called, and the entire while statement stops from running again. 

By using the continue statement, you can stop at the current loop location and skip to the start of the next loop iteration.  

switch and case The switch statement compares integer, string, or compile-time constants using == (equality). The switch statement is an alternative to the if and else statements. The switch statement evaluates an expression and uses the case clause to match a condition and executes code inside the matching case. Each case clause ends by placing a break statement as the last line. It’s not commonly used, but if you have an empty (no code) case clause, the break statement is not needed since Dart allows it to fall through. If you need a catchall scenario, you can use the default clause to execute code that is not matched by any of the case clauses, placed after all the case clauses. 

Functions are used to group reusable logic. A function can optionally take parameters and return values. I love this feature. Because Dart is an object-oriented language, functions can be assigned to variables or passed as arguments to other functions. 

Since all functions return a value, you start each function by specifying the return type expected. When calling a function and a return value is not needed, then start the function with the void type, meaning nothing. Using the void type is not required, but it’s recommended for readability. 

IMPORT PACKAGES 

To use an external package, library or an external class, use the import statement. Separating code logic into different class files allows you to separate and group code into manageable objects. The import statement allows access to external packages and classes. 

USING CLASSES 

All classes descend from Object, the base class for all Dart objects. A class has members (variables and methods) and uses a constructor to create an object. If a constructor is not declared, a default constructor will be provided automatically. The default constructor provided for you has no arguments. 

A constructor has the same name as the class, with optional parameters. The parameters serve as getters of values when initializing a class for the first time. Dart uses syntactic sugar to make it easy to access values by using the this keyword, referring to the current state in the class. Class Inheritance, Class Mixins.  

this chapter gave me a solid foundation in the Dart language. I learned how to add comments to my code for better readability and how the main() function serves as the starting point for an app. I explored how to declare variables to reference different types of values like numbers, strings, Booleans, lists, and more. I worked with Lists to store arrays of filters and learned how to iterate through their values. I also got familiar with operator symbols for arithmetic, equality, logic, conditional expressions, and cascade notation. The cascade notation stood out as a powerful tool for making multiple sequential calls on the same object, scaling and positioning it.
